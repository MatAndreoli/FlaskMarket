# FlaskMarket

## Starting setup
First, it's recommended to create a Virtual Environment. So, to do that, and I'm assuming that you have everything 
that is needed on your machine, run on your terminal:
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```
Then to install all that is needed, run:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If everything worked, just run:
```shell
python3 main.py
```
